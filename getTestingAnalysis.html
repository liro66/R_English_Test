About 2.8 million cases were treated in emergency department, and approximately 800,000 seniors went on to be hospitalized. More than 27,000 falls led to death. And the problem is getting more and more serious.\n“Older adult falls are increasing and, sadly, often indicate the end of independence,” said Dr. Tom Frieden. The falls are preventable, Frieden stressed. He said individuals, families and health care providers can take steps to resist the trend.\nDr. Wolf-Klein is a medical professor in New York. She said one concern is that seniors who have experienced a fall alone at home don’t tell anyone. When that happens, prevention efforts don’t begin and they’re at risk for additional falls that lead to broken bones and brain injuries.\n“Elderly patients tend not to report falls to their families, or even doctors. A fall is a very frightening thing that you keep quiet about. They think if they mention it, they are afraid that they will move to a nursing home or need assistants to help out in the house,” said Wolf-Klein.\nIt’s also a status issue and may make someone feel that they’re weaker than they really are, she explained. When someone does fall and hurt themselves, they’re often never the same, Wolf-Klein said. “You can develop chronic(慢性的)problems. After a fall, a percentage of the population will never return to walking around. People used to taking the subway, now they’re in a wheelchair, or they may need help going to the bathroom. They become frailer and lose independence,” she said.",

She enjoyed Where the Red Fem Grows and The Shiloh series, found in so many primary school classrooms, were all about white buys or dogs-or white boys and their dogs. Black girls, like Marley, were almost never the main character.\nWhat she was noticing is actually a much bigger issue: fewer than 10 percent of children’s books released in 2015 had a black person as the main character, according to a yearly analysis by the Cooperative Children’s Book Center. In November 2015, Marley set out to gather 1,000 books with black girls as protagonists(主角). Her campaign called”#1000BlackGirlBooks”was a big success. She far exceeded her goal and collected more than 10,000 books!” Through my campaign, I want to give kids a stronger sense of identity.” Marley says.  ”The biggest thing I’ve learned is that kid’s voices need to be heard.”\nIn the future, Dias wants to be the editor(编辑) of her own magazine. She is already making the steps toward having a successful and meaningful career At 11, she’s aware of the racism in the publishing industry.\nLike the television and movies, the publishing industry does not represent black girls or other people of color in positive ways. The whitewashing(漂白) in this industry extend beyond not having people of color as characters. In 2012, white men wrote 88% of the book reviews. In 2013, only about 2% of the books were about black characters. Then if there are people of color in the books, the publishers attempt to whitewash people of color on the covers.\nHowever, Dias is making it a little easier for other black girls searching for a character that is just like them. Her project is a positive step toward young black girls seeing and experiencing their lives in books.",

The district finished installing solar panels(太阳能板) for all three of its schools in 2016. Some of the panels can turn to fallow the sun across the sky.\nSheridan’s solar push is part of a trend. In 2008, fewer than 1,000 schools used solar power. By 2014, there were 3,727 schools with solar panels in the US. This data comes from a report by the Solar Foundation, an organization that promotes the use of solar power Roxie Brown, a program director there, says that the number of schools with solar panels has continued to rise since 2014.\nSolar power has some obvious advantage over other energy sources. Sunlight is a renewable(可再生的) resource, which means it won’t run out. Solar panels don’t harm the environment. Also sunlight is free. So by using solar power, schools can save money on energy costs over time.\nBut switching to solar power isn’t always easy Solar panels can be expensive to install. Sheridan Community Schools had to borrow money to pay for its solar transition. The panels also take up space. But for many schools, going solar is worth is.\nThe use of solar energy can also help students learn about electricity and environmental issues. Teacher at schools that use solar power often incorporate it into their science lessons. The kids talk about it in the classroom. Then they can look at it in action. According to Brown, the educational impact of solar panels it “the most compelling reason” for schools to install them.\nBrown hopes the panels will give Sheridan students a global perspective. “The world is bigger than the boundaries of their school district,” he says. “They’re doing things to help the world as a whole.”",

In 1998,when sea surface temperatures were the highest in recorded history coral reefs around the world suffered the most severe bleaching.It is estimated that even under the best of conditions, many of these coral reefs will need decades to recover.\nAlthough reefs face other threats from pollution, industrial activities, and overfishing, it is global climate change that most concerns scientists.Scientists remain hopeful that it’s not too late to save the reefs, and some are moving ahead on experiments to accomplish that goal.",

Despite the danger of throwing these hazardous materials in a landfill (垃圾填埋场)， that's exactly where tons of computers end up.\nAmericans reuse or recycle only about 10 percent of the 50 million computers they replace each year. according to ABC News. Eighty percent is being stockpiled (囤积)，which could create even bigger problems in the future，and the remaining 10 percent is landfilled. Throwing e-waste in landfills creates a potential for landfills are tougher in the United States than in many other countries, e-waste is often exported, especially to some developing countries.\nSome countries are creating policies to deal with the growing e-waste problem. In the Netherlands, you can bring your old computer to the seller when buying a new one, and the seller must by law accept it free of charge. Japan passed a law in 2001 requiring producers to recycle certain parts.\nIn the united states, a movement called the Computer Take Back Campaign is demanding that producers take more responsibility for disposing of (处理) old computers，California and Massachusetts recently prohibited certain computer parts in landfills，while Apple and IBM take back computers for about a $30 fee. Gateway is one step ahead: They will pay you $50 for recycling your old computer when you buy a new one from them. Lastly, many nonprofit programs accept used equipment, and services have popped up that distribute old computers to schools and other organizations. ",

The measure is part of a larger package of laws aimed at reducing tobacco use. If Governor Jerry Brown signs the bill, California will become the second state. after Hawaii. to raise the age limit for buying cigarettes and other tobacco products. More than100 cities in the U.S., including New York and Boston, have already raised the age limit.\nA week ago, the California Assembly approved the measure. Which- in addition to raising the age limit- treats electronic cigarettes the same as tobacco products. Expands smoke- free areas. increases smoking bans and allows counties to collect higher taxes on cigarettes than the 87-cent per pack state tax. The Assembly's vote came a few days after the city of San Francisco increased the age to buy tobacco products to 21.\nCalifornia lawmakers passed the bill despite lobbying (游说) from tobacco interests.The measure also faced opposition from many Republicans, who said the state should not be involved in policing people's personal choices. “I don't smoke. I don't encourage my children to,”said Republican Assemblyman Donald Wagner. “But they're adults. and it's our job to treat our citizens as adults.\"\nBut supporters of the bill say raising the age to 21 moves legally purchased tobacco that much farther from younger kids. \"This will save the medical system millions of dollars,”said Democratic Assemblyman Jim Wood. \"It will save thousands of lives. \" A 2015 study by the Institute of Medicine \"found that if the minimum legal age to buy tobacco were raised to 21 nationwide, tobacco use would drop by 12 percent by the time today's teens reached adulthood. In addition, there would be 223,000 fewer premature (过早的) deaths and 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer.\"",

The eighth-grader was inspired to kick off his mission on a recent morning, when his mother was driving him to school. Their car was damaged as it went over a huge pothole in the middle of the street in their hometown of Jackson, Mississippi.  \"I decided I was going to do something about the pothole problem in my city,\" Chokwe says. His solution: an app (手机应用) that warns drivers when there is a pothole ahead.\nChokwe developed the app with his friends Rodriguez. Ratliff and Emmanuel Brooks，\"When the app detects a pothole, it is highlighted (突出显示) in red,\" Chokwe says. \"And if you get close to the pothole, your phone will warn you,\" Drivers can also use the app to report any potholes they encounter, and to look for other routes they can take to avoid road that have them.\nThe app relies on current available information about the streets of Jackson. \"It works by using the city's 311 call system, so it uses information already stored in a database,”Chokwe says. Through the call system, citizens dial 3-1-1 to report non-emergency problems--which include potholes. Chokwe and his friends determined that focusing on the10 busiest streets in Jackson would give them a large enough sample size to test the prototype(原型)。\nAlthough the app isn't yet available for sale, Chokwe is already looking for ways to improve it. The prototype remains limited to 10 streets in Jackson, but he hopes to add more,so that is includes every street in the city, And then he wants to go even farther.  \"I want to keep working on the app until it's nationwide,\" Chokwe says.",
